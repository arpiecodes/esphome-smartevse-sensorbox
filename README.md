# esphome-smartevse-sensorbox

This ESPHome component code provides the basic functionality of SmartEVSE Sensorbox 2 (https://github.com/SmartEVSE/Sensorbox-2) within ESPHome.

- Sends current and voltage information to SmartEVSE master through modbus
- Both P1 and CT readings are supported through simple configuration
- Possibility to adjust power rotation and 3/4 wire configurations
- Basic protection against loss of CT/P1 data (internal timer unsets dataready telegram if no fresh data)
- Allows to use CT readings without actually using the CT readings for SmartEVSE (for example; solar production)
- Allows to log/consume a whole array of extra P1 measurement data with the DSMR ESPHome component

Basically if you already use Home Assistant and ESPHome, it can easily be flashed and used as a drop-in replacement for the original Sensorbox firmware without losing its core functionality of feeding P1/CT power data to SmartEVSE without having to rely on WiFi, network or (for example) Home Assistant.

Below YAML can simply be copied and paste'd in your ESPHome project and ESPHome will then automatically fetch the latest versions of the code and compile everything for you. No need to copy and paste any custom files. Please note that it is only meant to be uploaded onto Sensorbox 2 hardware. No out of the box support for other configurations (even though you could in theory make this work).

*NOTE: The PIC on your Sensorbox should be programmed to only provide CT measurements, else it may interfere with modbus communication. Please first install the original ESP32 Sensorbox 2 firmware and reboot the device once (so the PIC can be reprogrammed) before using the ESPHome component.*
